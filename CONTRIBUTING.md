# Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute and create a pull request at will, however, we will instantly deny any pull request that does not meet these guidelines, we will **not** fix issues for you.
With that said, here's our list of guidelines.

# Standards
- Naming Conventions **must** be consistent with the naming conventions currently being used (in this case `under_score`)    
- No "bodge" code, by this we mean don't want workaround fixes, things should be done the proper way.
- Do not create "cancer code" - i.e. writing so much code that it eventually causes a complete unorganised mess. To keep code clean, use the appropriate comment headers for what you're adjusting or adding if nessary.
- You are **not** required to comment on your code as long as you explain what it is doing within the pull request, although comments are helpful.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute please fork the in-dev branch [not master] and create a pull request as soon as you can, make sure your fork is also kept up to date.
The master branch represents the code which is currently "live" - i.e. it's being run off of the host - the in-dev branch is the branch in active development

# Discord Rewards
As I've mentioned on the discord server, you will receive rewards for contributions to the bot. The list of rewards are as follows:
- 1 Contribution: Contributor Profile Badge
- 3 Contributions: Contributor Rank
- Per Contribution: $2500 in-server money
- Active contributiors may receive additional rewards

# Testing
Testing of the in-dev branch is ran on a twin server, contributors with the Contributor Rank will be invited to this server to help with testing. The contributor role on the test server will give admin like permissions with the bot, however, everything is runnong off a seperate database and won't affect the live server.

# Collaborators/Staff
Administrators of Varsity Discord are given the Collaborator role for the moderation of the Issues and Pull requests feed, not all collaborators are active developers of the bot and are required to follow the same procedures as normal users, in which they need to create their own fork unless specified otherwise.
Staff members **should not** commit directly to any branches on this repository unless you're a approved developer (I.e. Harry)

# Disclaimer
Having an accepted contribution to the bot does not by any means grant you partial ownership or rights to the bot. In addition approved contributions may be removed at any time by the discretion of the developer.
